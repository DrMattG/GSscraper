This package contains a suite of functions to scrape search results from Google Scholar by using a function that pauses before downloading each page of results to avoid IP blocking. It then scrapes the locally saved files for citation relevant information.

The Shiny app can be run locally to provide a user interface. Navigate to 'inst > shiny-examples > GSscraper > app.R' in R Studio and click 'Run app'.
